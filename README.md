# Farm-monitoring-Product
Built an AI based product with a team that monitors crop health, irrigation requirement and expected yield of farm by using machine learning algorithms.

Goal is to combine all sources of information about your field in one place, identify and attend to possible problems and advise how to solve them. This is achieved by collecting satellite, weather, and soil data, supplemented with historical and forecasted trends.

Gif given below shows how to check  the reports of the farm we created.
